## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
![Data Architecture](https://github.com/keshavgupta8055/sql-data-warehouse-analytics-project/blob/main/docs/data_architecture.jpg)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as it is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into the SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
